# Project One for 355

Each folder represents a different webpage the order in which they should be opened is...

1. Landingpage
2. Tarkovhomepage
3. FocusedGuidepage
4. KF2homepage

I have kept them in these folders because each webpage has a bunch of images as local files 
so if you dont have them when you try to run the webpages they wont display properly.

the css files and js files are also named similarly so it could cause problems if you try to run them outside of their respective folder.
